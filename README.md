# Social-Media-Smartphones-Addiction

This project investigates how behavioral and technology use patterns, such as screen time, social media activity, and lifestyle choices, relate to smartphone addiction and Sleep Efficiency (%) among adolescents and young adults. We used two structured datasets from Kaggle: one for classification with over 13,000 records labeled by addiction status and another for regression with 500 entries measuring self-reported Sleep Efficiency (%).
